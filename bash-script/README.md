##
## What
-> This repo contains all my Shell script That I have wrote,
-> In every script there is a little comment that documents what script do ,
-> and how to use it.

## Why
Why I uploaded this to Github: 
- To store all my script remotely as form of backup.
- Easy to find informations in case I need it to.
- To be usable by other fellow hackers.  

## How
```bash
$ git clone 
$ cd 
$ ./script_name
```
It is possible to make the script globally available in your machine/server by placing the script in usr/local/bin folder

```bash
$ sudo cp system_monitor.sh /bin 
$ system_monitor.sh 
```
